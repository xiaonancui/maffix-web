# How the Gacha System Works

The gacha system is at the heart of Maffix's reward mechanism. Here's everything you need to know to maximize your chances of winning amazing prizes.

## Understanding Rarity Tiers

Our gacha system features 5 rarity tiers, each with different drop rates and prize values:

### C (Common) - 50% Drop Rate
- Basic merchandise items
- Small diamond bonuses (10-50 diamonds)
- Digital wallpapers and stickers
- Artist thank-you messages

### R (Rare) - 30% Drop Rate
- Quality merchandise (t-shirts, posters)
- Medium diamond bonuses (100-200 diamonds)
- Exclusive digital content
- Artist shout-outs on social media

### SR (Super Rare) - 15% Drop Rate
- Premium merchandise (hoodies, vinyl records)
- Large diamond bonuses (300-500 diamonds)
- Signed items
- Early access to new releases

### SSR (Super Super Rare) - 4% Drop Rate
- Limited edition merchandise
- Huge diamond bonuses (1000+ diamonds)
- Meet & greet opportunities
- Personalized video messages

### UR (Ultra Rare) - 1% Drop Rate
- One-of-a-kind items
- VIP concert experiences
- Studio visit opportunities
- Collaboration opportunities

## The SSR Guarantee System

One of our most popular features is the **SSR Guarantee**:

- Every 10x draw guarantees at least one SSR or higher item
- Your pity counter tracks draws since your last SSR
- Counter resets immediately after pulling an SSR
- Applies to all artist gacha pools

### How It Works

1. Start with a pity counter at 0
2. Each draw without an SSR increases the counter by 1
3. At 10 draws, you're guaranteed an SSR
4. Counter resets to 0 after getting an SSR

This ensures you always get value from your diamonds!

## Single vs 10x Draws

### Single Draw
- Cost: 100 diamonds
- Good for: Testing new pools, using leftover diamonds
- Pity counter: Increases by 1

### 10x Draw
- Cost: 1000 diamonds (same as 10 singles)
- Good for: Guaranteed SSR, efficient drawing
- Pity counter: Guaranteed SSR if you haven't pulled one in 10 draws
- **Recommended**: Always better value

## Tips for Maximizing Your Draws

### 1. Save for 10x Draws
Always save up 1000 diamonds for a 10x draw. The SSR guarantee makes it much better value than single draws.

### 2. Check Artist Pools
Different artists have different prize pools. Check what's available before drawing:
- View all available prizes
- Check rarity distributions
- Look for limited-time items

### 3. Participate in Events
Special events often feature:
- Increased SSR rates

### 4. Premium Membership Benefits
