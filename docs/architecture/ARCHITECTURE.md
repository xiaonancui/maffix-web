# TenTenTen Web - System Architecture

## Overview

TenTenTen Web is built as a modern, scalable full-stack application using a
three-tier architecture that separates concerns between presentation, business
logic, and data persistence. The system is designed to handle the unique
requirements of a musician fan engagement platform with gamification elements.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Client-Side Layer (Frontend)

**Technology**: Next.js 14 + Refine + TypeScript

**Responsibilities**:

- User interface and experience
- Client-side routing and navigation
- State management and caching
- Authentication flow management
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections

**Key Components**:

- **Pages**: Route-based components using Next.js App Router
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements built with Tailwind CSS
- **Providers**: Context providers for authentication, theme, and data
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for API interactions and state management
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

### 2. Server-Side Layer (Backend)

**Technology**: NestJS + TypeScript + Prisma

**Responsibilities**:

- Business logic implementation
- API endpoint management
- Authentication and authorization
- Data validation and transformation
- External service integrations

**Key Modules**:

- **Auth Module**: JWT-based authentication and session management
- **User Module**: User profile and preference management
- **Task Module**: Task creation, assignment, and completion tracking
- **Gacha Module**: Randomized reward system logic
- **Payment Module**: Klarna integration for transactions
- **Analytics Module**: Data collection and reporting

### 3. Data & Services Layer

**Technology**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + External APIs

**Responsibilities**:

- Data persistence and retrieval
- Real-time data synchronization
- File storage and CDN
- External service integrations

## Data Flow Example: Gacha Draw Process

```
1. User initiates Gacha draw (Frontend)
   ↓
2. Authentication validation (Frontend → Backend)
   ↓
3. Diamond balance check (Backend → Database)
   ↓
4. Gacha algorithm execution (Backend)
   ↓
5. Reward generation and assignment (Backend → Database)
   ↓
6. Balance update transaction (Backend → Database)
   ↓
7. Real-time notification (Backend → Frontend via WebSocket)
   ↓
8. UI update with new reward (Frontend)
```

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Entities

**Users**

- Authentication and profile information
- Diamond balance and transaction history
- Preferences and settings

**Artists**

- Artist profiles and verification status
- Content and media management
- Analytics and performance metrics

**Tasks**

- Task definitions and requirements
- Completion tracking and validation
- Reward configuration

**Gacha System**

- Item definitions and rarity tiers
- Draw history and probability management
- Collection and inventory tracking

**Transactions**

- Payment processing records
- Diamond purchases and usage
- Audit trail for financial operations

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Architecture

- Resource-based URLs (`/api/users`, `/api/tasks`)
- HTTP methods for operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent response formats with proper status codes
- Pagination for large datasets

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting and throttling
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### Data Validation

- Input validation using class-validator
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling with structured responses
- Request/response transformation with DTOs

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security

- Secure JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management and token refresh
- OAuth integration for social login

### Data Protection

- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- XSS protection with proper encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Payment Security

- PCI DSS compliance through Klarna integration
- Secure API key management
- Transaction logging and audit trails
- Fraud detection and prevention measures

## Deployment Architecture

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

- **Build Process**: Next.js static generation and optimization
- **CDN**: Global edge network for fast content delivery
- **Environment**: Serverless functions for API routes
- **Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and performance monitoring

### Backend Deployment (Railway)

- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment
- **Scaling**: Automatic horizontal scaling based on load
- **Environment**: Managed environment variables and secrets
- **Monitoring**: Application logs and health checks

### Database (Supabase)

- **High Availability**: Multi-region PostgreSQL setup
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Security**: Row-level security and encrypted connections
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with WebP support
- **Caching**: Browser caching and CDN optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring

### Backend Optimization

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **API Optimization**: Response compression and pagination

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- Stateless backend services for easy scaling
- Database read replicas for improved performance
- CDN for global content distribution
- Load balancing for high availability

### Future Enhancements

- Microservices architecture for complex features
- Event-driven architecture with message queues
- Advanced caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Machine learning integration for personalization

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality

- TypeScript for type safety across the stack
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Automated testing with Jest and Cypress

### CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Automated deployment on successful builds
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database migration management

### Monitoring and Logging

- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User analytics and behavior tracking
- Infrastructure monitoring and alerts
