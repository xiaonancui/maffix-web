## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. ❌ Backend architecture doesn't match documentation
2. ❌ No database connection (Prisma not configured)
3. ❌ Insecure demo authentication
4. ❌ Zero tests in codebase
5. ❌ API URL mismatch (3001 vs 8000)

### Major Issues (Should Fix)
1. ⚠️ Monolithic backend (all code in one file)
2. ⚠️ No input validation
3. ⚠️ Minimal error handling
4. ⚠️ No layered architecture
5. ⚠️ Missing backend tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)

### Strengths (Keep)
1. ✅ Good frontend structure (Next.js 14)
2. ✅ Modern tech stack
3. ✅ CI/CD configured
4. ✅ Documentation exists
5. ✅ Monorepo setup
